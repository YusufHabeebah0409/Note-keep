🛍️ Product List Manager
A simple and interactive web app that allows users to add, edit, delete, and manage a list of products. Built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — perfect for practicing DOM manipulation and array operations.

🔧 Features
✅ Add new products to a list

📝 Edit existing products

🗑️ Delete individual products

❌ Delete all products at once (with confirmation prompt)

🚫 Prevents adding empty products

👀 Dynamic button visibility based on product count

💻 How It Works
Products are stored in a local array (cart)

When a user adds a product, it's pushed into the array and displayed as a table row

Each product row includes:

Edit button — loads the item into the input field for editing

Delete button — removes the item after confirmation

If two or more products exist, a "Delete All" button is shown

After deleting all products, the button hides automatically

Technologies Used
HTML for structure

CSS (Bootstrap) for styling

JavaScript for logic and DOM manipulation
